smallpump
=========

A bit of JavaScript to show a user's pump.io recent activity.

The JavaScript should be adapted to your own use.  Certainly you will want to change what pump.io feed you're pulling from.

Activity feeds are found at: /api/user/<nickname>/feed/major

Some OAuth is required to get access to them, so for now we'll work with a static file.
